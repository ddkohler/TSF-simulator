# TSF simulator

This TSF simulator is a user-friendly wrapper for simulating VVE-TRSF under the [NISE](https://github.com/wright-group/NISE) package.  The simulator considers a system with two vibrational modes ('I' and 'i'), and their two-quantum modes (overtones and combination band).  There are two electronic states (`a` and `b`) that can be accessed from the two-quantum states.

## Setup

To setup, clone this repo to a `PYTHONPATH` folder.  You will also need [NISE](https://github.com/wright-group/NISE), numpy, scipy...

## Contents

* `lib.py` - library of functions useful for processing
* `run.py` - a template for running NISE simulations
* `H_TRSF.png` - image illustrating the states built in to this hamiltonian
